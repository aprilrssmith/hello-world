# hello-world
My first stand alone repository

I am working hard to become a front-end web developer. I want to create amazing user interfaces and beautiful, responsive websites. I love the beauty of code in all of its grand simplicity.

I am an artist and have been for my whole career thus far, but I've always dreamed becoming proficient in web development. I completed a Ruby on Rails dev bootcamp a few years ago. I love knowing how the server side works, but am more interested in the visual beauty and user interaction on the front end.
